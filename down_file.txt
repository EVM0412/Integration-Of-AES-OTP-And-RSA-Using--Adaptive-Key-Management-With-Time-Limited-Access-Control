    The extensive healthcare dataset created for this study includes a wide range of vital characteristics on patient wellbeing, including complex information about medical histories, diagnoses, treatment plans, and other important aspects of the healthcare industry. With the main objective of strengthening the protection of patient data privacy and security, this priceless dataset acts as the cornerstone for a thorough investigation into the possible uses of cryptographic techniques inside healthcare systems. By carefully examining this information, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of cryptographic techniques, such as but not limited to AES, RSA, and ECC, in preventing unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, this dataset provides a real-world setting for the thorough assessment of how various cryptographic algorithms affect the safe transmission of healthcare data, making a substantial contribution to creating compliant and secure healthcare information systems.
